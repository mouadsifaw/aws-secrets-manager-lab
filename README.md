# 🔐 AWS Secrets Manager Lab

This project is a hands-on lab where I learned how to securely manage and automatically rotate database credentials using **AWS Secrets Manager**, **Lambda**, and **Amazon RDS**.

---

## 🚀 What I Built

- ✅ Stored Amazon RDS credentials in **AWS Secrets Manager**
- 🔁 Configured automatic credential rotation with **Lambda**
- 🔒 Set up a **VPC endpoint** so Lambda can access secrets securely
- 🧪 Tested access to RDS with rotated credentials
- 📋 Used **CloudWatch Logs** to verify everything was working

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to securely store and rotate secrets in AWS  
- Best practices for connecting AWS services inside a VPC  
- Using Lambda with Secrets Manager  
- Debugging with CloudWatch logs  
- Real-world cloud security skills

---

## 📌 Why This Matters

Managing secrets manually is risky and doesn’t scale. This setup keeps credentials secure and fresh automatically — a key part of building production-ready cloud apps.
